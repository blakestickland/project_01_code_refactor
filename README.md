##  1: Code Refactor

Purpose: Refactor an exisitng page to make it accessible.

# Process:

-- Added a meaningful descriptive title to the website.
-- Added meta data to increase search engine success.
-- Added semantic HTML elements to boost accessibility.
-- Added alt attributes to image elements and a descriptive title to the hero image.
-- Moved elements and classes in the CSS to follow the semantic structure.
-- Checked that headings fell in sequential order.
-- Consolidated the CSS classes in the main section and the sidebar. 
-- Maintained the original layout.

# Future development ideas:

-- Make it "mobile-friendly" by adding media queries in Javascript (reactive design).
-- Add more content (the class "header" was kept as a class in the event other html pages may be built later linked to the this page or this company).
-- Make the header fixed so site navigation is easier if the site gets larger with more content.
-- Add a "back to top" link at the bottom of each section that will jump to the top of the page when clicked.
-- Add an Email section so that clients can inquire directly from the site. 
-- Decrease the resolution of the hero image to allow it to load faster.
